The file here "firstsite" is a django project directory. 
This project is a basic contact list supported on my Ubuntu v16.04 server running with nginx and uwsgi interfaces. 
Data handling is done with the default sqlite database package included within python. 
There is no current method for reading the data out of the database but it is in development currently.
